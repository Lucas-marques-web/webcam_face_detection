# Webcam Facial Detection

This Python script utilizes OpenCV for real-time facial detection using your computer's webcam. It loads a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier to detect faces in each frame from the webcam feed. Detected faces are outlined with a blue rectangle.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library (you can install it using `pip install opencv-python`)

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have OpenCV installed.

2. Connect or activate your computer's webcam.

3. Run the `main.py` script.

4. A window titled 'Facial Recognition' will appear, displaying the webcam feed.

5. The script will continuously detect faces in the webcam feed.

6. Detected faces will be outlined with blue rectangles in real-time.

7. You can press the 'q' key to exit the program.

## Features

- The script uses a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier for face detection.

- It continuously captures frames from the webcam and detects faces in each frame.

- Detected faces are highlighted with blue rectangles.

- The script runs until you press the 'q' key to exit.


Feel free to use this script as a starting point for webcam-based facial recognition projects or adapt it to suit your specific requirements!
